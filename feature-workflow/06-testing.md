# Step 6: Testing (Manual)

> **Usage:** After completing implementation and review (Steps 4-5), testing happens outside this conversation.

## What Happens in This Step

This is **Matthew's manual testing phase**. I (GitHub Copilot) am not running tests—Matthew is.

## My Role

After Step 5 (Code Review), I:

1. Summarize what was implemented
2. Highlight areas to test (Work vs Personal behavior, edge cases, migrations)
3. Provide testing checklist if helpful
4. **Wait for Matthew's test results**

## Matthew's Manual Testing

Matthew will manually test:

- Feature works in Work calendar
- Feature works in Personal calendar
- Existing tasks/data unaffected
- No console errors
- Voice capture still works (if task-related)
- Edge cases and failure scenarios
- Data migration (if applicable)

## After Testing

**If bugs found:**

- Matthew reports issue
- I fix and we iterate (back to Step 4 or wherever needed)
- Re-test

**If tests pass:**

- Matthew says "tests pass" or "looks good"
- We proceed to Step 7 (Deployment)

---

**This step is outside the conversation. I wait for Matthew's feedback before proceeding to Step 7.**
